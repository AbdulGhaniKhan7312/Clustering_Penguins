# Clustering_Penguins

Arctic Penguin Exploration: Unraveling Clusters in the Icy Domain with K-means Clustering

Utilized unsupervised learning skills to clusters in the penguins dataset!

1. Imported, investigated, and pre-processed the "penguins.csv" dataset.

2. Performed a cluster analysis based on a reasonable number of clusters and collected the average values for the clusters. The output is a DataFrame named stat_penguins with one row per cluster that shows the mean of the original variables by cluster.
